## Example

Get the first matching pair of braces:

```js
import liquidRegex from "liquid-regex";
var balanced = require('balanced-match')
const str = "{{a}}}";
const pattern = /\{([^\}]+)\}/;
const match = balanced(pattern, str.replace("{{", "").replace("}}", ""));
const str = "{{a}}}";
const match = liquidRegex(/\{([^\}]+)\}/, str);


console.log(match);
console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{in{nested}}post'))
console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{first}between{second}post'))
console.log(balanced(/\s+\{\s+/, /\s+\}\s+/, 'pre  {   in{nest}   }  post'))
```

The matches are:

```bash
$ node example.js
{ start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
{ start: 3,
  end: 9,
  pre: 'pre',
  body: 'first',
  post: 'between{second}post' }
{ start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
```

## API

### var m = balanced(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
object with those keys:

- **start** the index of the first match of `a`
- **end** the index of the matching `b`
- **pre** the preamble, `a` and `b` not included
- **body** the match, `a` and `b` not included
- **post** the postscript, `a` and `b` not included
console.log(match);


If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

const str = "{{a}}}";
const match = balanced("{", "}", str.replace("{{", "").replace("}}", ""));
<!-- If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `['{', 'a', '']` and `{a}}` will match `['', 'a', '}']`. -->

<!-- ### var r = balanced.range(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
array with indexes: `[ <a index>, <b index> ]`.

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `[ 1, 3 ]` and `{a}}` will match `[0, 2]`. -->
